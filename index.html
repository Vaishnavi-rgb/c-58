    <p>I like cooking a lot. You know why beacuse there is no rule or fomula to do that this thing in this way maybe there coube but not in mine I always try to do some or the dishes while watching youtube. I my previous recipir i made an orea pudding and my brother loves a lot. I always make tea for my mom every evening. This all i learned by my mother while watching her.My opinion is that cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. Cooking is my hobby and has been for several years. I was about five years old, when I started learning how to cook. Cooking is something that I inherited from my grandmother; my grandmother was a professional chef and owned her own restaurant, where I learned how to cook.There are so many reasons I love to cook, cooking is one of those things that just comes naturally for me, and I think I inherited, because I can cook almost anything and nail it on the first try, much like my grandmother. But the main reason I love to cook is because it keeps me stress free. For example when I am cooking I have very little time to think, because the cooking is challenging my mind and taking my mind off the stress of everyday life.
